# Camplify Demo UI

Validate your camplify setup with this demo React UI. The sample usage setup file automatically builds this project so that it can be used to generate your cdk-exports.json file before continuing with your local UI development. The contents of cdk-exports.json are displayed in the terminal after deployment.
